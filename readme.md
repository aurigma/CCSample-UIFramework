# UI Framework Config Examples

Here you can find some examples for the UI Framework JS library for Aurigma's [Customer's Canvas](https://customerscanvas.com). 

## Requirements

You need to use these configs using UI Framework JS library which is [available at npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aurigma/ui-framework).

## How to work with it

Refer [UI Framework documentation](https://customerscanvas.com/support/ui-framework) for more details.

## How this repository is organized

It has two folders: 

- **usage** - includes some short configs which illustrate the usage of certain widgets, syntax, config sections, etc. They are useful when you are learning how to work with it.
- **editors** - includes some real configs which can be used in your applications. They are also great starting point if you want to create some custom configs yourself.
